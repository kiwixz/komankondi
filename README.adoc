= komankondi

komankondi is a game with one simple premise: you have to guess a word given its definition.


== Compiling

The game is expected to build on Linux and Windows; with the following commands:
----
python3 configure
meson compile -C build
----

You can also skip the `configure` script and directly call `meson setup` if you want more control.


== Dictionary

Before playing you will need a komankondi dictionary.  This is nothing more than a compressed database of words and their definition.  The easiest way to get one is to run the `komankondi-dictgen` tool.  It takes a source as argument, and currently it only supports extracting the data from the https://wiktionary.org[wiktionary].  Prepend the desired language code; so for example to download data from the english (en) wiktionary you would execute the following:
