= komankondi

komankondi is a game with one simple premise: you have to guess a word given its definition.


== Compiling

The game is expected to build on Linux and Windows; with the following commands:
----
python3 configure
meson compile -C build
----

You can also skip the `configure` script and directly call `meson setup` if you want more control.
